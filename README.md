🚀 Projects
AI Voice Assistant (JARVIS) | Python, NLP, Automation                                                                         
• Built an end-to-end Python-based voice assistant integrating NLP, LLM APIs (Groq, Cohere, Hugging Face), and 
Google Search API, supporting 25+ voice commands for automation, search, and conversational tasks 
• Designed a multi-threaded architecture enabling concurrent speech recognition, GUI updates, and background 
processing, reducing response latency by ~40% and preventing UI blocking 
• Implemented an intelligent query routing system using the Cohere API, achieving ~85–90% classification 
accuracy across conversational, real-time search, and automation workflows 
• Integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech pipelines using Selenium WebDriver, Web Speech API, and 
Microsoft Edge TTS, delivering sub-1.2s average voice response time 
• Developed a PyQt5-based GUI and automation framework supporting 15+ system actions, improving task 
execution efficiency by ~30% and enabling scalable feature expansion
